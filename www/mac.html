      <h3>Before you start...</h3>
      <div class='w3-panel w3-card w3-round'>
        <samp class='am-exe'>getidmis</samp> makes use of a program
        called <samp class='am-exe'>cURL</samp> to grab files from the
        internet. It requires at least version&nbsp;8 of this software
        to handle the password protected certificate files. To see
        what version you have, open a command prompt and type
        <samp>curl --version</samp> If you can upgrade to the latest
        version before installing
        <samp class='am-exe'>getidmis</samp>, things will definitely
        go smoothly! If you can't, then the installer will try to work
        out your hardware architecture and install a local copy of the
        correct version. Since I don't have a recent Mac, I cannot
        test this!

        <h3>Obtaining the getidmis installer...</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Click on this link: <a class='w3-button w3-teal'
                                   href='install.sh'
                                   download='install.sh'>&nbsp;GetIDMIS 
              Installer&nbsp;</a>
            to download it - I am assuming you will download it to
            your <samp class='am-folder'>Downloads</samp> folder.
          </li>
          <li>
            Depending on your browser, you may obtain an alert saying
            something like <i class='am-message'>'Insecure download
              blocked'</i>. Click
            the <samp class='am-button'>keep</samp> option.
          </li>
          <li>
            With Chrome or Edge browsers, the download may get 'stuck'
            as a <samp class='am-exe'>Unconfirmed
              xxxxx.crdownload</samp> file. If this is the case, click
            the <samp class='am-button'>download progress</samp>
            button and click the <samp class='am-button'>Keep</samp>
            button. Alternatively, go to the
            <samp class='am-folder'>Downloads</samp> folder and rename
            the file to <samp class='am-exe'>install.sh</samp>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          <strong>Note:</strong> The dire warnings about 'insecure
          downloads' really can be safely ignored! They are <i>not</i>
          suggesting any security issues with the file itself, they
          are simply saying that it is downloaded over HTTP rather
          than HTTPS (which encrypts the file as it is being downloaded).
        </p>

        
        <h3>Running the getidmis installer...</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Double-click on <samp class='am-exe'>install.sh</samp> in
            your <samp class='am-folder'>Downloads</samp> folder.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Mac may respond with an alert box
            warning about running untrusted software.
            Click whatever you need to, to run it anyway!
          </li>
          <li>
            The installer will prompt you for your certificate
            password (as supplied by Antonio).
          </li>
          <li>
            It will create a <samp class='am-folder'>getidmis</samp>
            folder in your home folder (below I refer to that new
            folder as <samp class='am-folder'>Home...getidmis</samp>)
            and save your certificate password there. It will then
            download the actual
            <samp class='am-exe'>getidmis</samp> software and the newer
            versions of the <samp class='am-exe'>curl</samp> program.
            As above, if you can make sure that
            <samp class='am-exe'>curl V8.0</samp> (or higher) is
            installed before you start, then
            <samp class='am-exe'>getidmis</samp> will use that.
          </li>
          <li>
            The installer will also prompt you to install the
            certificate file (as supplied by Antonio) in the
            <samp class='am-folder'>getidmis</samp> folder. Copy this
            file (typically called
            <samp class='am-exe'><i>surname</i>-cert.p12</samp>, from
            wherever you downloaded it, into the
            <samp class='am-folder'>Home...getidmis</samp> folder
            and rename it to <samp class='am-exe'>cert.p12</samp>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Finally, the installer will tell you to press
            <samp class='am-button'>Enter</samp> to indicate you have
            finished.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      
      <h2>Running getidmis on the Mac</h2>
      
      <div class='w3-panel w3-card w3-round'>
        <ol>
          <li>
            In the <samp class='am-folder'>Home...getidmis</samp>
            folder, there is a file called
            <samp class='am-exe'>getidmis.sh</samp>. Copy this file
            to wherever you want to download the files from
            IDMIS.<br />
            
            For example, if you are downloading the files for PL132,
            you might have created a folder
            called <samp class='am-folder'>Documents/PL132</samp>, so
            copy <samp class='am-exe'>getidmis.sh</samp> to that
            folder.
          </li>
          <li>
            Double click on the copy of
            <samp class='am-exe'>getidmis.sh</samp> that you just
            made. Files will be downloaded from IDMIS to that folder.
          </li>
          <li>
            You then enter the request numbers for the document you
            wish to download. You can enter one number per line, or
            multiple numbers on a single line separated by spaces -
            do <strong>not</strong> use any other characters such as
            commas or semi-colons!
          </li>
          <li>
            When you are done entering numbers, simply press
            <samp class='am-button'>Enter</samp> another time to enter
            a blank line.
          </li>
          <li>
            All the files associated with each request number will
            then be downloaded!
          </li>
        </ol>
